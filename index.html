            <strong>Welcome!</strong>
            <br />
            Thanks for participating in my listening test! The resulting data will aid in my evaluation of an artificial speech synthesiser built on my voice.
            <br />
            The overall test will take roughly <strong>10 minutes</strong>. Please take the time and carefully rate every item.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please do NOT do this test without ear-/headphones! It would be <u>counterproductive</u> and degrade the quality of my results. The same holds true for rushing through the test.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Instructions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Listen through each test sample and give a rating based on <strong>how natural it sounds</strong>.</li>
                <li>There are 3 hypotheses being tested, each containing 6 sentences, for a total of 18 tests.</li>
                <li>Ratings are on a precise numerical scale, where <strong>0</strong> sounds like two cats fighting and where <strong>100</strong> represents true natural speech.</li>

            <strong>What is Speech Synthesis?</strong>
            <br />
            Speech synthesis is the artificial production of human speech. A computer system used for this purpose is called a speech synthesizer. A text-to-speech (TTS) system, like the one evaluated here, converts normal language text into speech.
            <br />
            <br/>
            <strong>How does it work?</strong>
            <br />
            This system uses a method known as unit selection. Unit selection synthesis uses large databases of recorded speech. During database creation, each recorded utterance is segmented into some or all of the following: individual phones, diphones, half-phones, syllables, morphemes, words, phrases, and sentences. Typically, the division into segments is done using a specially modified automatic speech recognition system set to a "forced alignment" mode with some manual correction afterward. An index of the units in the speech database is then created based on the segmentation and acoustic parameters like the fundamental frequency (pitch), duration, position in the syllable, and neighboring phones. At run time, the desired target utterance is created by determining the best chain of candidate units from the database (unit selection). This process is typically achieved using a specially weighted decision tree.
            Unit selection provides the greatest naturalness, because it applies only a small amount of digital signal processing (DSP) to the recorded speech. <a style="color:blue" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">(source)</a>
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> The sentences selected for this test are quite hard, and this specific system was built with only a few hours of recording material over the course of two and a half months. In other words, don't expect the same quality as Siri/Google Now/Amazon Echo, which have been under development for years and use thousands of hours of (professional) recording material.
